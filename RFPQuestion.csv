What is a club?,"A Club serves between 8-12 different clients, large and small, across industries and tech stack. Each Club has its own physical space – a Clubhouse – with its own management team and the autonomy to make its own decisions based on the needs of its people and clients.

Each ANDi is part of a small, tight-knit cross-functional team called a Squad. Six Squads, with practice leadership roles and a management team, form what we call a 'Club'.

Tenzing operates as a support function to Clubs and other parts of the organisation It provides services such as recruitment, onboarding, and coaching."
